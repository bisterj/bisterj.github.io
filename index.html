                <h2>About Me:</h2>

		<p>My name is Jakob Bister, I am a dual citizen of the United States and Sweden. 
                        My parents worked as Bible translators in Mozambique, so that's where I've spent 
                        most of my life. I would be defined as a third culture kid, meaning that I don't 
                        belong to a single place. I was born in the US, grew up in Africa and I 
                        speak/understand a variety of languages. This gives me a international mindset but 
                        also makes me someone who will never fit into the ideals of the world. I love to solve 
                        problems and just mess around with code. Not sure what I want to end up doing with 
                        code/tech but I'm sure it's what I want to do.</p>

                <h2>"Adding", "committing" and "pushing" changes...</h2>

		<p>"Adding" changes is when you push the changes you have made to the staging area. The next step is to commit these changes. </p>

                <p> "Committing" a change means that you have decided that your code changes are complete, and you are ready to commit them to the final code.</p>

                <p> Finally, "Pushing" is when you request for your personal changes to be added to the master file for the project. This means that the fixes that you made will be integrated into the source code for the project.</p>

                <h2>You need to fork when...</h2>
                <p>...You would like to take a project in a direction
                 which may not be suitable for or in agreement with
                 the project's initial intention.</p>

                <h2>More about open source</h2>
                <p>Free, open source software is software that is
                shared freely and available to build upon. It is an
                effective way to apply your skills to various projects
                and social causes. You can participate by writing or
                reviewing code, answering users' questions,
                translating the interface to another layout, making
                video tutorials to help new users, and myriad other
                ways. Open source software is often produced by lots
                of people collaborating across oceans and borders, and
                this event specially welcomes newcomers to that style
                of event.</p>

                <p>Open source participation is one way to gain
                code skills and make connections that will last
                you through your career. Volunteer staff will include
                professionals and academics who use open source
                daily.</p>

                <h2>What is CSC 426?</h2>
                <p>CSC 426 is a computer science class at Berea College.
		The complete title is CSC 426: Open Source Software
		Engineering. Here is the catalog description: </p>

		<p>An introduction to open source software engineering,
		the course covers the philosophy and practice of
		developing software in large, distributed teams. Students
		will explore social and technological aspects of this
		process by contributing directly to an existing open
		course project. In doing so, students will learn the
		tools, the techniques, and the strategies -- technical
		and social -- that are common to all developers working
		in teams through this semester-long exercise.</p>
