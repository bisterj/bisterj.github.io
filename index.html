                                        My name is Jakob Bister, I am a dual citizen of the United States and Sweden. 
                                        My parents worked as Bible translators in Mozambique, so that's where I've spent 
                                        most of my life. I would be defined as a third culture kid, meaning that I don't 
                                        belong to a single place. I was born in the US, grew up in Africa and I 
                                        speak/understand a variety of languages. This gives me a international mindset but 
                                        also makes me someone who will never fit into the ideals of the world. I love to solve 
                                        problems and just mess around with code. Not sure what I want to end up doing with 
                                        code/tech but I'm sure it's what I want to do.
                                </p>
